## Graph traversal exercises

1. Add a depth first search using recursion to the adjacency list graph.<br>
You might wish to use a HashSet to contain the visited nodes.<br> 
This is like a dictionary but it only has keys and provides a fast way to look up whether a or not a vertex has already been visited.<br>
However if you do this you will need a separate list to store the path of the traversal as the hashset will not guarantee to return items in the order they were added.<br>
2. Add another method for depth first search but write an iterative method using a stack.<br?
3. Write a method for breadth first search using a queue.<br>
