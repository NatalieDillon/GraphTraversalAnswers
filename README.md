## Graph traversal exercises

Using the pseudo code with which you have been provided<br>

1: Add a depth first search using recursion to the adjacency list graph.<br>
2: Add another method for depth first search but write an iterative method using a stack.<br>
3: Write a method for breadth first search using a queue.<br>

Note:<br>
You might wish to use a HashSet to contain the visited nodes.<br> 
This is like a dictionary but it only has keys and provides a fast way to look up whether a or not a vertex has already been visited.<br>
However if you do this you will need an additional list to store the path of the traversal as the hashset will not guarantee to return items in the order they were added.<br>
