## Graph traversal exercises

1. Add a depth first search using recursion to the adjacency list graph. 
You might wish to use a HashSet to contain the visited nodes. This is like a dictionary but it only has keys and provides a fast way to look up whether a or not a vertex has already been visited.
2. Now add another method for depth first search but write an iterative method using a stack
3. Write a method for breadth first search using
a queue.
