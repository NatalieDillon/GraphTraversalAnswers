## Graph exercises

Represent a graph using both an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list</br>
It has been assumed for the moment that the vertices will be a string</br>

1. Implement IGraph using an adjacency matrix. A 2-Dimensional array will represent the edges. A list of strings will represent the vertices.</br>
2. Implement IGraph using an adjacency list. Use a dictionary of dictionaries.</br>
3. Test your code, there is some example test code in Program.cs. Add to this or create your own unit tests</br>

Extension:
Now create a text file with some example graph data (you might wish to look up some real data such as the travel times between different underground stations) and add code to upload this data into a graph and test it</br>
