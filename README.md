## Graph traversal exercises

1. Add a depth first search using recursion to the adjacency list graph. To verify that it works use test data from the graph in GraphExercises_2.pptx. It will probably be fastest to use a HashSet (like a dictionary but only with keys) for the list of visited vertices. However if you want to be sure that the visit order is preserved then you will need to use a List as well.
2. Write another method for depth first search but use a stack
3. Write a method for breadth first search. It will be the same as the depth first search with a stack but it will use a queue.
